# ric-chatGPT

## Description
This is a project to create a chat bot using OpenAI API and ChatGPT.  
The chat bot will have the task to answer questions regarding my technical skills, work experience and career since I started as Front End developer.  

The project is made up of two different elements:  

### Client
***React App.***  
The client will be the interface through which questions can be asked and answers can be viewed.  
The client will communicate with the backend server to send all questions to an API endpoint and will receive the answer back from the server.  

### Server
***Node + Express App.***  
The server will work as a proxy and implement all logic to communicate between the client and OpenAI API.
